title: "Sneakerhead Gear"
subtitle: "STAT 385 FA2018 - Team XSWL"
abstract: |
          | This project aims to design a shiny-powered app to address an underlying difficulty of many sneaker lovers & collectors, which is to buy or trade sneakers at reasonable prices. The goal is to scrape real-time price information from StockX, one of the most popular stock market for sneakers, and produce visualizations as well as give predictions for the prices of popular items by incorporating statistical computing methods. The motivation behind this project is a shared experience among the group members about previous hardships involved with trading sneakers, and a strong desire to work with web scrapping and to practice statistical methods with R. The expected gain is hence as stated above.

# Introduction

- What problem or topic are you addressing?



- Why is it interesting or important? In particular, what evidence supports this conclusion?
- Cite papers or reputable sources that back up this claim. (You may want to find - material using Google Scholar.)

- Where did the problem or topic come from?

- What is your idea for addressing the problem or topic?

- How does your idea match with the courseâ€™s focus on statistical programming?

Consider adding subsections in this section. For example, consider adding
a **data** subsection. The data subsection would describe your data. 
What is it? Where did it come from? How will it be useful in answering your problem?
Provide references to information about the data, but explain enough that your
reader does not need to utilize them.

Keep in mind, you may use or construct any dataset of your choice under two
conditions:

1. there is a minimum of **500** observations and **10** variables;
2. data is _not_ from either UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository or Kaggle,
   _not_ used as a data set in the course, and _not_ found in textbooks.
   
The dataset may be relevant to research outside of this course, another field,
or some other interest of the groups. If you have any questions about whether 
your data is appropriate, do not hesitate to ask. If you plan to use data from
either a research project or current job be sure to gain permission from the
data controller.

# Related Work

The **Related Work** section must provide an overview of pre-existing solutions.
In essence, please credit those who enabled you to consider embarking on this 
project, or as Issac Newton in [a letter to Robert Hooke on 15 February 1676](http://www.newtonproject.ox.ac.uk/view/texts/normalized/OTHE00101) more
aptly put it:

> If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants.

Address the following questions:

- What other ideas have been attempted?
- Why is your team's idea original compared to prior work?

# Methods

The **methods** section should discuss how you plan to solve your problem.
The overall details of the project including any preliminary work. In 
particular, the implementation details behind the approach should be explained
at length here. The more details you can provide, the better feedback your
group can receive. As a result, the section serves as a roadmap of what features
are going to be developed and any external dependencies that are required. 
**The majority of your code should be _suppressed_ from the displaying in this
section**. Please refer to code and figures placed in the appendix. The latter can be referenced using: 

```
Figure \@ref(fig:code-chunk-name-here).
```

For example, the figure of the data science workflow is accessible via
Figure \@ref(fig:data-science-workflow).

To satisfy this section, provide detailed responses for the following:

- What packages will you use in your implementation?
- What code will the group need to write for the project?
- Provide low-fidelity prototypes (e.g. _sketches_ on paper) in the **Appendix** of:
    - Visualisations
        - What kinds of graphs will you use?
        - Label axes, provide a title, and mention any interactivity.
    - Interface
        - All projects need a Shiny Application.
        - Sketch how a user will work with the shiny application.
- What have you done or learned so far for the project? 

We are primarily wanting to ensure that your project has met the criterion
of the data science pipeline. In essence, we want to see evidence that your
project has:

- Reading data into _R_ or accessing data via an API.
- Data transformations (e.g. Tidying ([`tidyr`](http://tidyr.tidyverse.org/)), Summarizing ([`dplyr`](http://dplyr.tidyverse.org/)), et cetera.)
- Data visualization (e.g. [`ggplot2`](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/),
  [`plotly`](https://plot.ly/ggplot2/), [`gganimate`](https://github.com/dgrtwo/gganimate))
- R functions either in external packages or included in a new _R_ package
- Interactive Interface (e.g. [`shiny`](https://shiny.rstudio.com/))
- Reproducibility

# Feasibility

The **Feasibility** section is meant to act as a way to reflect upon the proposal.
Generally speaking, there will be three weeks of heavy development time afforded
to the group. Building a detailed ecosystem or heavily scripting in a different
language will likely not lead your team to success. Hence, please provide
a project management overview of *who* on your team will be doing *what* and *when*
by answering:

- Is this project able to be completed before the end of the semester?
- What steps must occur to complete the project before the end of the semester?
- What is the work plan to accomplish the necessary tasks before the end of the
  semester?
  - Specify who is doing what and when.
  - Consider making a [Gantt chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_chart)
    to highlight each stage of the project.

# Conclusion

The **Conclusion** section provides a summary of the entire proposal. This acts
as the final paragraph that can be used to justify the work being proposed.
In general, this means you should make one last push to identify the problem,
potential solution, and its novelty.

If a group's project is well written, uses thoughtful and creative approaches,
and is sufficiently interesting you may be asked to have your work "published"
as an example for future students. **All group members will have to agree to
publication.** You may also be asked to make edits before publication, but you 
should be sure to **proofread** and **spellcheck** your work before your
initial submission.

\newpage

# Appendix

The **Appendix** section contains figures, sample data, and other miscellaneous
entries. Generally, this sketch seeks to contain all of your _planning_ information.

- Provide the sketches of visualisations and the shiny application.
- Provide an overview on the desired functions.
    - What is a function's input? Output? How are functions related to each other.
    - For example, `read_data("hospital_data.csv")` must be called before `tidy_hospital()`, et cetera.
- Provide a sample of the data set you intend to use (~10 observations).

If you used previous code chunks within the document, this information can
be dynamically retrieved and embedded.

```{r, ref.label=knitr::all_labels(),echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}

```

```{r hitters-data}
kable(
  head(mtcars, 20),
  format = "latex",
  caption = "This is an example of a table in the Appendix. Notice that it is way too big, and has way too much information. We use the $\\texttt{kableExtra}$ package to shrink it down, but even then, no one would actually read this table.",
  booktabs = TRUE
) %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped", "scale_down"))
```

```{r wage-data}
kable(
  head(mtcars, 20),
  format = "latex",
  caption = "This is another example of a ridiculous table. Notice that it is automatically numbered.",
  booktabs = TRUE
) %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped", "scale_down"))
```


## Formatting Notes


### `R` Code and `rmarkdown`

An important part of the report is communicating results in a well-formatted manner. This template document should help a lot with that task. Some thoughts on using `R` and `rmarkdown`:

- Chunks are set to not echo by default in this document.
- Consider naming your chunks. This will be necessary for referencing chunks 
  that create tables or figures.
- One chunk per table or figure!
- Tables should be created using `knitr::kable()`.
- Consider using `kableExtra()` for better presentation of tables. (Examples in this document.)
- Caption all figures and tables. (Examples in this document.)
- Use the `img/` sub-directory for any external images.
- Use the `data/` sub-directory for any external data.

### LaTeX

While you will not directly work with LaTeX, you may wish to have some details
on working with TeX can be found in 
[this guide by UIUC Mathematics Professor A.J. Hildebrand ](https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/~hildebr/tex/latex-start.html).

With `rmarkdown`, LaTeX can be used inline, like this, $a ^ 2 + b ^ 2 = c ^ 2$,
or using display mode,

$$
\mathbb{E}_{X, Y} \left[ (Y - f(X)) ^ 2 \right] = \mathbb{E}_{X} \mathbb{E}_{Y \mid X} \left[ ( Y - f(X) ) ^ 2 \mid X = x \right]
$$

You **are** required to use BibTeX for references. With BibTeX, we could 
reference the `rmarkdown` paper [@allaire2015rmarkdown] or the tidy data paper.
[@wickham2014tidy] Some details can be found in the 
[`bookdown` book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/citations.html). Also,
hint, [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) makes obtaining BibTeX 
reference extremely easy. For more details, see the next section...

<!-- Force a new page for references -->
\newpage

# References

The **References** section acts as a bibliography for all papers referenced
in the **Introduction**, **Related Works**, and **Method** sections. The
references should be formated in Chicago author-date format, which is the
default for RMarkdown.

* Provide a list (5+) of papers or items you have read to write this proposal. 
* Please list all _R_ packages or software referenced.

To acquire software citation information, _R_ has a built-in command
that creates a BibTex and in-line text citation. To generate the citation
of an installed _R_ package, type:

```r
# In R
citation(package="pkg_name")
```

For example, to cite `dplyr`, one would generate the BibTex entry from:

```r
citation(package="dplyr")
```

```latex
@Manual{dplyr:2018,
    title = {dplyr: A Grammar of Data Manipulation},
    author = {Hadley Wickham and Romain FranÃ§ois and Lionel Henry and Kirill MÃ¼ller},
    year = {2018},
    note = {R package version 0.7.7},
    url = {https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dplyr},
}
```

Note, we added a "name" to the autogenerated citation of `dplyr:2018`. Using
this name, we can reference the work within the paper via [@dplyr:2018] or @dplyr:2018.
